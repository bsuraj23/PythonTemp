Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning

pattern = re.compile("d")
pattern.search("dog")     # Match at index 0

pattern.search("dog", 1)  # No match; search doesn't include the "d"
